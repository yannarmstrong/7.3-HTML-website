# 7.3 Organization & Style

###### ICS3U - Mr. J

There is a web-lesson [on my website](https://sites.google.com/ocsb.ca/ics3u-ash/units/unit-7-html/7-3-organization) with a brief explanation and lots of links to amazing resources.

- [Part 1: Organization](#part-1-organization)
- [Part 2: Style (CSS)](#part-2-style-css)
- [Your Task](#your-task)

## Part 1: Organization

![File Organization Chart](images/file_org.png)

Organizing your files in any situation is important - in a web server it's even _more_ important. It can reduce confusion, create better security, and helps if you're working in a team.

Take a good look at the image above ([source](https://youtu.be/RniGO9Ek6yY)) and see how a typical website is organized.

This repository is organized in a similar fashion. As a matter of fact, that image above is in the [images](images) folder of this repo. As you work through [the task](#your-task), try to continue this organizational style - _**including naming your files appropriately**_.

## Part 2: Style (CSS)

A demonstration was given in class and there are lots of helpful explanations and resources [on our class website](https://www.brash.ca/ics3uc/4/3).

_Essentially_, HTML is for the _content_ of a page and CSS is for the _style_ of the page. This separation also helps with organization and you can apply the same style on any page you want without having to copy and paste the code!

You will find a [CSS file](css/main_style.css) inside the [CSS folder](css). This file is being loaded by the [index.html](index.html) file on line 8:

```HTML
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/main_style.css">
```

You can create separate CSS files or use one file on your entire site to give it a common look and feel. **Take a look at the CSS that is already in the file and play around - feel free to delete or modify to suit your needs**.

## Your Task

Over the next couple classes you are going to create a website with multiple pages and incorporate _content_, _images_, and _style_.

#### Select from one of the following types of websites

- **Personal Portfolio:** a site that showcases your skills, projects, and experiences. Create a digital presence for your creations.
- **Blog or Personal Website:** a place where you can write about various topics that interest you or your own poetry or opinions.
- **Restaurant / Cafe / Fictional Business:** design a site for a fictional small cafe or place to eat. Include a menu, location, hours of operation, contact details, images...
- **Resume Website:** perhaps more difficult for multiple pages but combined with a small portfolio of experience or work, this could be good!
- **Tribute Page:** obsessed with an artist, charity, book, or famous person? Create a tribute page to that person, group, or cause. Show your love, admiration, and knowledge about them!
- **Event Website:** design a website for a fictional event such as a conference, concert, or festival. Include the event schedule, location(s), guests or performers, ticketing details, etc...
- **Have inspiration for a different idea?** Pitch it to your teacher!

#### Your site **_must_** include the following

- Multiple pages that link to each other (appropriately named and organized)
- At least one external link to another page or resource on the Internet
- Mutiple images, appropriately named and organized
- _Some_ style elements to change sizes, colours, or locations to your liking
- A _sources.html_ page that catalogs where you took information or images from for this site. (This is _mandatory_)

#### Your site **_must not_** include

- Plagiarism (_stolen_ HTML or media)
- Inappropriate language or images/media
- Images of classmates or people without their permission
- Private information (this is a public site)
